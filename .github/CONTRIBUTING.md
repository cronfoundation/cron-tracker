## How Can I Contribute?

NEO Tracker is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into NEO Tracker itself.

### Reporting Bugs

Well-written bug reports with consistently reproducible steps are invaluable to the development of NEO Tracker. Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Before creating an issue, please perform a [search](https://github.com/neotracker/neotracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) to see if the problem has already been reported. After you've determined a bug does not already exist, create an issue and fill in the template.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to NEO Tracker? Here are some great ways to get started:

- Chat with us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/391302767781740545/391302768234594314) about ways to contribute!
- Find an existing issue with the [help wanted and good first issue](https://github.com/neotracker/neotracker/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp%20wanted+label%3Agood%20first%20issue) labels.

Once you've had your first pull request approved and merged, find existing issues marked with [help wanted](https://github.com/neotracker/neotracker/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp%20wanted) labels to continue contributing or suggest an enhancement. Respond on the issue thread expressing interest in working on it. This helps other people know that the issue is active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.
