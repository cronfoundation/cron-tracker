You do not create an account or give us your funds to hold\nonto. No data leaves your computer or your browser. We make it easy for you to\ncreate, save, and access your information and interact with the blockchain.Forked \nfrom Neo Tracker.\n\n\n## How does it work?\nLight wallet means that CRON Tracker Wallet does not require syncing locally with\nthe blockchain and instead, uses a remote server, namely CRON Tracker Blockchain\nExplorer, to fetch data like the transaction history or the amount of CRON\navailable to claim. Note that **none** of your personal data is ever sent to\nCRON Tracker. Specifically, your Private Keys and encrypted Keystore files never\nleave your local computer.\n\n\n## How secure is it?\nCRON Tracker Wallet **never** sends your Private Keys or encryped Keystore files\nacross the network. They are stored locally on your computer. Private Keys are\nonly ever stored in the current session's memory and are cleared between\nsessions. Encrypted Keystore files are stored in local storage and persist across\nsessions. If an attacker were to gain access to your browser's local storage, they\nwould additionally need the password to unlock your encrypted Keystore file in order\nto gain access to your Private Keys and thus your balance.\n\n\n## How can I trust CRON Tracker Wallet?\nCRON Tracker Wallet source code is available on (NEO TRACKER FORK)[Github](https://github.com/cronfoundation)\nfor you to verify. We serve the wallet over SSL (https) which eliminates the\npossibility of tampering with the Javascript code between our servers and your\nbrowser. Still not sure? Download the latest standalone release on our\n[Github releases](https://github.com/cronfoundation) page\nand open it using your browser. Alternatively, you can build directly from the source.\n\n\n## What if I forget my encrypted Keystore file's password or lose my Private Key?\nCRON Tracker Wallet does not hold your keys for you. We cannot access accounts,\nrecover keys, reset passwords, nor reverse transactions. Protect your keys and\nalways check that you are on the correct URL. You are responsible for your security.\n\n\n## We are not responsible for any loss.\nCRON, neotracker.io and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are\nunder active development. While we have thoroughly tested, there is always the\npossibility something unexpected happens that causes your funds to be lost.\nPlease do not invest more than you are willing to lose, and please be careful.\n`;\n\ntype ExternalProps = {|\n  className?: string,\n|};\ntype InternalProps = {|\n  classes: Object,\n|};\ntype Props = {|\n  ...ExternalProps,\n  ...InternalProps,\n|};\nfunction
